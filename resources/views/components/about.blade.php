      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Our Mission</h3>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 font-medium">At Conscience Homes, our mission is to empower individuals on
        their path to recovery by offering a supportive and compassionate environment that is deeply informed by lived
        experience. We recognize that just as Evidence-Based Practice relies on research evidence, Lived Experience
        Informed Practice is grounded in the wisdom gained from lived experiences. Therefore, our approach places lived
        experience at the forefront, acknowledging it as the cornerstone of our practice. We are committed to actively
        listening to and learning from individuals with lived experience, integrating their insights into our framework
        for learning how to live. By prioritizing the voices and perspectives of those who have walked the path of
        recovery, we strive to create a community where everyone feels heard, understood, and empowered to reclaim their
        lives from addiction.</p>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Our Vision</h3>

        At Conscience Homes, our vision is to pioneer a transformative model of recovery housing, fostering a supportive
        and collaborative atmosphere. We provide housing that goes beyond mere accommodation, nurturing a community
        where members make individual choices and engage in collective decision-making. Through this approach, we
        cultivate an environment where personal growth, autonomy, and resilience thrive. Guided by collective wisdom, we
        envision every member thriving, reclaiming their lives from addiction, and building a purpose-driven future.
